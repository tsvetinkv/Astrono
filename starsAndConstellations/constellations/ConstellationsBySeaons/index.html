    <section class="winter">
        <h2>Winter constellations</h2>
        <p class="textCentered">To see the constellations that come and go with the seasons, we need to turn our backs
            on the north
            circumpolar
            constellations and face south. <br> If the winter sky seems alive with stars, it’s no illusion. Besides the
            obvious
            facts that the air is clear and dry then, we’re looking at a star-rich region <br> that defines one of the
            spiral
            arms of our Milky Way Galaxy. Of the twenty-one brightest stars in the entire night sky (so-called
            1st-magnitude
            stars), <br> seven are in this area.</p>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="text">
                <p>On a winter evening, the sky is home to what <br> most astronomers agree is the grandest of all <br>
                    constellations —
                    Orion
                    the Hunter. A rectangle <br> of bright stars, which includes, at opposite <br> corners,
                    1st-magnitude
                    Betelgeuse and
                    Rigel, <br> is bisected by a diagonal row of three bright stars <br> (the “belt”). Beneath the belt
                    hangs a
                    row of
                    three <br>
                    stars — Orion’s “sword.” Don’t be fooled by their <br> uninspiring naked-eye appearance; the middle
                    <br> star
                    in the
                    sword
                    isn’t a star at all. The Orion <br> Nebula is a captivating sight, resembling a fuzzy <br> patch of
                    light in
                    binoculars,
                    where stars are born.

        <p class="textCentered">Orion serves as the centerpiece for a dazzling group of stars and constellations. Follow
            Orion's belt to find
            Sirius, the brightest star, leading <br> Canis Major. It shimmers beautifully near the horizon during
            winter.</p>
        <p class="textCentered">Continuing from Orion's belt, locate the V-shaped Hyades representing Taurus the Bull's
            "head" and the
            Pleiades
            cluster nearby.</p>
        <p class="textCentered">Taurus's uppermost horn connects to Capella in Auriga the Charioteer, situated above
            Orion.</p>
        <p class="textCentered">Orion's companions include Gemini the Twins, found by extending a line from Rigel
            through Betelgeuse. In
            2005,
            Saturn joins Gemini. <br> Midway between Sirius and Pollux and Castor, you'll spot the 1st-magnitude star
            Procyon,
            representing Canis Minor, the Little Dog.</p>

        <h2>Spring constellations</h2>
        <p class="textCentered">As the days lengthen and the weather warms, Orion and his wintry retinue process slowly
            into the western sky.
            Leo the Lion now assumes center stage <br> high in the south. Leo’s most noticeable feature is an asterism
            (a
            grouping of stars) that reminds observers of a sickle or a backward question mark. The <br> period on the
            question mark is the 1st-magnitude star Regulus. To the left of the Sickle are three stars that form a right
            triangle. We see the Lion from <br> the side; the Sickle outlines his head, and the triangle, his
            hindquarters.
            Viewed with a little imagination, Leo definitely sports a feline profile.</p>

                <p style="text-align: right;">During spring, the Big Dipper appears nearly <br> overhead from
                    mid-northern latitudes. If you <br> follow the
                    handle
                    of the Dipper away from the <br> bowl, you’ll “arc to Arcturus,” a golden-yellow <br> 1st-magnitude
                    star in
                    the
                    constellation Boötes <br> the Herdsman. The constellation itself is shaped <br> like a huge kite,
                    with
                    Arcturus at its
                    base. Continuing <br> the arc, you’ll “sprint to Spica.” This blue-white <br> 1st-magnitude star is
                    in Virgo,
                    which is
                    a huge, <br> sprawling constellation. If you look below and to <br> the right of Spica, you’ll spot
                    a neat
                    little
                    group of <br> four bright stars that resembles the outline of a sail.</p>

        <p class="textCentered"> This is the constellation Corvus the Crow. I’m always impressed at how stately this
            little constellation
            looks, perched above the treetops to the south on a <br> clear spring evening.</p>

    <section class="summer">
        <h2>Summer constellations</h2>
        <p class="textCentered">Summer is a season of mixed blessings for astronomers. The nights are warm but short and
            often hazy. As if
            that weren’t bad enough, we have to contend with <br> swarms of blood-sucking mosquitoes! Haze and insects
            aside,
            the summer sky is a veritable gallery of cosmic masterpieces. The Milky Way arches high across <br> the sky,
            which is richer than its winter counterpart because we now look toward the heart of our galaxy. Dominating
            the evening sky are three 1st-magnitude <br> stars forming the Summer Triangle. Vega is the brightest of the
            three and is located in a nifty little constellation called Lyra the Lyre.</p>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="text">
                <p>Deneb, the second star in the Summer Triangle, <br> serves as the celestial tail of Cygnus the Swan,
                    <br> and,
                    along
                    with four other prominent stars of <br> the Swan, collectively composes the striking <br> asterism
                    known as
                    the
                    Northern Cross, which <br> is intricately woven within the ethereal tapestry <br> of the Milky Way,
                    with Deneb
                    majestically adorning <br> the pinnacle of the cross while Albireo, a renowned <br> double star,
                    graces its
                    base with
                    its captivating hues <br> of radiant golden yellow and mesmerizing sapphire <br> blue, a remarkable
                    spectacle
                    that
                    demands the power <br> of a telescope to fully appreciate.

            constellation,
            <br>
            <b>Aquila the Eagle</b>. If you follow the Milky Way from Aquila toward the southern horizon, you
            should
            find a
            group of stars that looks like a teapot. <br> This asterism is part of <br>
            <b>Sagittarius the Archer</b>. This constellation marks the location of our galaxy’s center. The
            area teems
            with
            deep-sky treasures — especially bright nebulae <br> and star clusters. To the right of the teapot is the
            ruddy
            1st-magnitude star Antares, the “heart” of <br>
            <b>Scorpius the Scorpion</b>. Like the winter star Betelgeuse, Antares is a red supergiant star in
            the last
            stages
            of its life. A fishhook-shaped row of stars trailing <br> down and to the left of Antares forms the
            Scorpion’s
            tail and stinger, while an upright row of three stars to Antares’s right marks the location of its
            claws.

        <h2>Autumn constellations</h2>
        <p class="textCentered">As the nights begin to lengthen and a chill pervades the air, the summer Milky Way exits
            center stage
            (although the Summer Triangle remains visible in <br> the west until early winter). Following the Summer
            Triangle
            is one of the night sky’s prettiest constellations — Delphinus the Dolphin. Four stars, arranged <br> like a
            diamond, form the Dolphin’s head, while a fifth creates the tail. You can imagine a dolphin leaping out of
            the water as you gaze at this constellation.</p>

                    Pegasus the

                    Alpheratz is at the top <br> left corner of the Great Square. From here, two rows <br> of stars

                    up.
                    This is the constellation <br> Andromeda the Princess. And yes, it is home to the <br> great
                    Andromeda Galaxy.
                    At a
