                    <p>
                        Our solar system, with its eight planets orbiting a solitary
                        Sun, feels familiar because it's where we live. But in the
                        galaxy at large, planetary systems like ours are decidedly
                        in the minority. More than half of all stars in the sky have
                        one or more partners. These multiple star systems come in a
                        stunning variety of flavors: large, hot stars orbited by smaller,
                        cooler ones; double stars orbited by planets; pairs pulsing with
                        X-rays as one sheds material that is devoured by the other.

                        Double-star systems offer a diverse array of characteristics, much like
                        the galaxy's overall stellar population. These pairs exhibit a wide mass
                        range, such as a medium-sized yellow star orbiting a smaller red dwarf.
                        Some evolve asymmetrically, with one star becoming a red giant while
                        the other remains stable. These systems can host planets. Pairs of
                        neutron stars canspiral together and collide, producing heavy elements,
                        like gold, platinum, and iodine.

                    <h2>X-ray Binaries</h2>
                    <p>
                        X-ray binaries involve material transfer between stars. When a
                        massive star exhausts its nuclear fuel and becomes a white dwarf,
                        neutron star, or black hole, it can gravitationally pull material
                        from its close companion, emitting X-rays. These binaries provide
                        insights into phenomena like pulsar emissions, thermonuclear
                        explosions, and the presence of material forming accretion disks
                        around the stars.

                    <p>
                        Some multiple star systems include three stars or more,
                        their orbits intricately intertwined by gravity. As many
                        as seven stars have been observed in a single system.
                        Like binaries, triple-star systems can host planets.
                        In a three star system, two stars orbit each other,
                        then the pair and a third star also orbit each other.
                        In a quadruple star system, two pairs of stars orbit
                        each other, and these two pairs, in turn, orbit each other.
