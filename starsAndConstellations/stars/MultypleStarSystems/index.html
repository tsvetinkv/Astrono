                    <p>
                        Our solar system, with its eight planets orbiting a solitary <br>
                        Sun, feels familiar because it's where we live. But in the <br>
                        galaxy at large, planetary systems like ours are decidedly <br>
                        in the minority. More than half of all stars in the sky have <br>
                        one or more partners. These multiple star systems come in a <br>
                        stunning variety of flavors: large, hot stars orbited by smaller, <br>
                        cooler ones; double stars orbited by planets; pairs pulsing with <br>
                        X-rays as one sheds material that is devoured by the other.

                    <p>
                        Double-star systems offer a diverse array of characteristics, much <br> like
                        the galaxy's overall stellar population. These pairs exhibit a wide <br> mass
                        range, such as a medium-sized yellow star orbiting a smaller red <br> dwarf.
                        Some evolve asymmetrically, with one star becoming a red giant <br> while
                        the other remains stable. These systems can host planets. Pairs <br> of
                        neutron stars canspiral together and collide, producing heavy <br> elements,
                        like gold, platinum, and iodine.

                    <h2>X-ray Binaries</h2>
                    <p>
                        X-ray binaries involve material transfer between stars. When a <br>
                        massive star exhausts its nuclear fuel and becomes a white dwarf, <br>
                        neutron star, or black hole, it can gravitationally pull material <br>
                        from its close companion, emitting X-rays. These binaries provide <br>
                        insights into phenomena like pulsar emissions, thermonuclear <br>
                        explosions, and the presence of material forming accretion disks <br>
                        around the stars.

                    <p>
                        Some multiple star systems include three stars or more, <br>
                        their orbits intricately intertwined by gravity. As many <br>
                        as seven stars have been observed in a single system. <br>
                        Like binaries, triple-star systems can host planets. <br>
                        In a three star system, two stars orbit each other, <br>
                        then the pair and a third star also orbit each other. <br>
                        In a quadruple star system, two pairs of stars orbit <br>
                        each other, and these two pairs, in turn, orbit each other.
