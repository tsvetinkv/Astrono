                – which in numbers is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. Our Milky Way alone
                contains more than 100 billion, including our most well-studied star, the Sun.
                Stars are giant balls of hot gas – mostly hydrogen, with some helium and small
                amounts of other elements. Every star has its own life cycle, ranging from a
                few million to trillions of years, and its properties change as it ages.</p>

                    <h2>Birth of stars</h2>
                    <p>Stars form in large clouds of gas and dust called
                        molecular clouds.<br>
                        Molecular clouds are cold which causes gas to clump,
                        creating<br>
                        high-density pockets. Some of these clumps can collide
                        with each <br> other or collect more matter, strengthening their
                        gravitational force <br> as their mass grows. Eventually,
                        gravity causes some of these clumps <br> to collapse.
                        When this happens, friction causes the material to<br>
                        heat up, which eventually leads to the development
                        of a protostar <br> – a baby star. Batches of stars that
                        have recently formed from molecular <br> clouds are often
                        called stellar clusters and molecular clouds full of stellar<br>
                        clusters are called stellar nurseries.</p>

                    <p class="rightAlign">At first, most of the protostar’s energy comes from
                        heat released by <br> its initial collapse. Over millions
                        of years, high pressures and temperatures <br> in the core
                        trigger nuclear fusion, turning hydrogen into helium, <br>
                        releasing energy that counteracts gravity. These stable
                        stars <br> are called main sequence stars, and this phase
                        lasts millions or <br> billions of years. Our Sun is midway
                        through it. A star's mass <br> determines how fast it uses
                        its gas fuel. Lower-mass stars burn <br> longer, appearing
                        dimmer and cooler than massive stars, which burn <br> fuel
                        faster. Some low-mass stars can shine for trillions of
                        years, <br> while massive stars live only a few million years.</p>

                    <h2>Death of stars</h2>
                    <p>As a star's core depletes its hydrogen, gravity starts <br> to compress it.
                        This compression raises its temperature <br> and pressure, causing the star
                        to expand. The outcome <br> of this process varies with the star's mass.
                        Low-mass <br> stars evolve into subgiants or giants, fusing helium <br> into carbon,
                        as our Sun will eventually. Some giants <br> pulsate, shedding their atmospheres
                        to form planetary <br> nebulae. The core, known as a white dwarf, gradually cools <br>
                        over billions of years. High-mass stars undergo fusion to create <br> heavier
                        elements, such as oxygen and magnesium, while the <br> most massive stars eventually
                        reach iron fusion, which depletes <br> their energy quickly. This results in a core
                        collapse, followed by a <br> supernova explosion. The core becomes either a neutron
                        star or a <br> black hole. Supernova dispers materials, enriching future molecular <br>
                        clouds and seeding new star formation.</p>
