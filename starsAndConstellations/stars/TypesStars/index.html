                        The universe is filled with an astonishing diversity of stars,
                        each possessing unique characteristics that set them apart
                        from one another. Stars vary widely in terms of their
                        brightness, size, color, and behavior. Some types change into
                        others very quickly, while others stay
                        relatively unchanged over trillions of years.

                        A normal star forms from dust and gas in a stellar
                        nursery, gaining mass and heating up over hundreds of thousands of years.
                        When its core reaches millions of degrees, nuclear fusion begins
                        as hydrogen nuclei merge into helium, releasing
                        energy that counters gravity. Such stars, known as main sequence stars,
                        make up about 90% of all stars. They vary in size, color,
                        and luminosity, with lifespans ranging from millions to billions of years.

                        can observe individual white dwarfs like LP 145-141 in Musca (southern constellation) and

                            Red dwarfs, the smallest main sequence stars, are cooler and often appear orange in color.
                            They
                            maintain a constant fusion process that allows them to burn through their hydrogen supply
                            for
                            trillions of years without significant structural changes. Some low-mass red dwarfs, just a
                            third of
                            the Sun's mass, may have lifespans exceeding the current age of the universe, up to about
                            14
                            trillion years. Red dwarfs are abundant and make up roughly 75% of the Milky Way's stellar
                            population.

                            Red dwarfs are too faint to see with the unaided
                            eye. But with a backyard telescope, you may be
                            able to see Lacaille 8760 in the southern constellation
                            Microscopium or Lalande 21185 in the
                            northern constellation Ursa Major.

                                Brown dwarfs aren’t technically stars. They’re more massive than planets but not quite
                                as
                                massive as
                                stars. Generally, they have between 13 and 80 times the mass of Jupiter. They emit
                                almost
                                no

                                light, but scientists have seen a few in infrared light. Some brown dwarfs form the same
                                way as
                                main
                                sequence stars, from gas and dust clumps in nebulae, but they never gain enough mass
                                to do
                                fusion on
                                the scale of a main sequence star. Others may form like planets, from disks of gas and
                                dust
                                around

                            Brown dwarfs are generally invisible to both the unaided eye and small backyard telescopes
                            due
                            to their faintness and small size.
