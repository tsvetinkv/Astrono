                        others very quickly, while others stay <br>
                        relatively unchanged over trillions of years.

                        A normal star forms from dust and gas in a stellar <br>
                        nursery, gaining mass and heating up over hundreds of <br> thousands of years.
                        When its core reaches millions of <br> degrees, nuclear fusion begins
                        as hydrogen nuclei merge <br> into helium, releasing
                        energy that counters gravity. Such <br> stars, known as main sequence stars,

                        and luminosity, <br> with lifespans ranging from millions to billions of years.

                        When a main sequence star under eight solar masses exhausts <br> core hydrogen, it collapses due
                        to
                        gravity, raising temperature <br> and pressure. Helium fusion into carbon releases energy, <br>
                        causing
                        hydrogen fusion to expand the outer layers, <br> forming a red giant. These red giants often
