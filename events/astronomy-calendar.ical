DESCRIPTION:The Quadrantids is an above average shower, with up to 40 met
 eors per hour at its peak. It is thought to be produced by dust grains lef
 t behind by an extinct comet known as 2003 EH1, which was discovered in 2
 003. The shower runs annually from January 1-5. It peaks this year on the 
 night of the 3rd and  morning of the 4th. This year the nearly full moon w
 ill block out most of the fainter meteors. But if you are patient you may 
 still be able to catch a few good ones. Best viewing will be from a dark l
 ocation after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Bootes
 , but can appear anywhere in the sky.

DESCRIPTION:The Draconids is a minor meteor shower producing only about 10
  meteors per hour. It is produced by dust grains left behind by comet 21P 
 Giacobini-Zinner, which was first discovered in 1900. The Draconids is an
  unusual shower in that the best viewing is in the early evening instead o
 f early morning like most other showers. The shower runs annually from Oct
 ober 6-10 and peaks this year on the the night of the 7th. The second quar
 ter moon will dark skies in the early evening for what should be a good sh
 ow.  Best viewing will be in the early evening from a dark location far aw
 ay from city lights. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Draco, b
 ut can appear anywhere in the sky.

DESCRIPTION:Тауридите са дълготраен малък метеорен дъжд, произвеждащ около 
 5-10 метеора на час. Необичайно е с това, че се състои от два отделни потока.
 Първият се произвежда от зрънца на прах, оставени от Asteroid 2004 TG10.
 Вторият поток е произведен от отломки, оставени от Comet 2P Encke.
 Дъждът продължава всяка година от 7 септември до 10 декември.
 Тази година достига своя връх в нощта на 4 ноември и сутринта на 5-ти.
 Втората четвърт на луната ще блокира повечето от мрачните метеори 
 тази година. Но ако сте търпеливи, все пак може да успеете да хванете
 няколко добри. Най-доброто гледане ще бъде точно след полунощ от тъмно
 място, далеч от градските светлини. Метеорите ще излъчват от съзвездието
 Телец, но могат да се чуят навсякъде в небето.

 wild ground phlox, which is one of the first spring flowers. This moon ha

DESCRIPTION:The Eta Aquarids is an above average shower, capable of produ
 cing up to 60 meteors per hour at its peak. Most of the activity is seen i
 n the Southern Hemisphere. In the Northern Hemisphere, the rate can reach
  about 30 meteors per hour. It is produced by dust particles left behind b
 y comet Halley, which has known and observed since ancient times. The sho
 wer runs annually from April 19 to May 28. It peaks this year on the night
  of May 6 and the morning of the May 7. The nearly new moon means dark ski
 es for what should be an excellent show this year. Best viewing will be fr
 om a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constella

DESCRIPTION:The Geminids is the  king of the meteor showers. It is conside
 red by many to be the best shower in the heavens, producing up to 120 mul
 ticolored meteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by debris left behi
 nd by an asteroid known as 3200 Phaethon, which was discovered in 1982. T
 he shower runs annually from December 7-17. It peaks this year on the nigh
 t of the 13th and morning of the 14th. The nearly full moon will block out
  all but the brightest meteors this year. But if you are patient, you may
  still be able to catch a few good ones. Best viewing will be from a dark 
 location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Gemin
 i, but can appear anywhere in the sky.

DESCRIPTION:The Draconids is a minor meteor shower producing only about 10
  meteors per hour. It is produced by dust grains left behind by comet 21P 
 Giacobini-Zinner, which was first discovered in 1900. The Draconids is an
  unusual shower in that the best viewing is in the early evening instead o
 f early morning like most other showers. The shower runs annually from Oct
 ober 6-10 and peaks this year on the the night of the 7th. Unfortunately t
 he glare from the nearly full moon will block most of the meteors this yea
 r. Combined with the low hourly rate it would probably be best to skip thi
 s one unless you are really patient. Best viewing will be in the early eve
 ning from a dark location far away from city lights. Meteors will radiate 
 from the constellation Draco, but can appear anywhere in the sky.
